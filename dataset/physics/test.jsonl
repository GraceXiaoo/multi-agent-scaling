{"question": "Industrial_Area category contains metal fabrication shop, and industrial park.\nFood_Wholesale category contains canned goods wholesaler, and frozen food distributor.\nFrozen_Food category contains frozen meat products, and frozen bread.\nFish category contains grouper, and mackerel.\nThe number of each frozen food distributor 's frozen bread equals the sum of each industrial park 's canned goods wholesaler and each industrial park 's frozen food distributor.\nThe number of each frozen meat products 's mackerel equals 6.\nThe number of each frozen food distributor 's frozen meat products equals the sum of each frozen meat products 's mackerel, each industrial park 's frozen food distributor, and each industrial park 's canned goods wholesaler.\nThe number of each canned goods wholesaler 's frozen meat products equals 10.\nThe number of each metal fabrication shop 's canned goods wholesaler equals 22 times each frozen bread 's grouper.\nThe number of each industrial park 's frozen food distributor equals 11 times each frozen meat products 's mackerel.\nThe number of each metal fabrication shop 's frozen food distributor equals 21 times each frozen food distributor 's Frozen_Food.\nThe number of each frozen bread 's grouper equals each frozen meat products 's grouper.\nThe number of each frozen meat products 's grouper equals the sum of each frozen food distributor 's frozen meat products, each frozen meat products 's mackerel, and each canned goods wholesaler 's Frozen_Food.\nThe number of each frozen bread 's mackerel equals 21 more than the difference of each metal fabrication shop 's Food_Wholesale and each industrial park 's frozen food distributor.\nThe number of each industrial park 's canned goods wholesaler equals 18 times the sum of each industrial park 's frozen food distributor and each frozen meat products 's mackerel.\nThe number of each canned goods wholesaler 's frozen bread equals the sum of each frozen meat products 's mackerel, each metal fabrication shop 's frozen food distributor, each frozen food distributor 's Frozen_Food, and each frozen food distributor 's frozen meat products.\nHow many mackerel does frozen bread have?", "answer": "Define each frozen meat products 's mackerel as S; So S = 6.\nDefine each industrial park 's frozen food distributor as F; So F = 11 * S = 11 * 6 = 20.\nDefine each industrial park 's canned goods wholesaler as N; F = F + S = 3 + 6 = 3; So N = 18 * F = 18 * 3 = 8.\nDefine each frozen food distributor 's frozen bread as J; So J = N + F = 8 + 3 = 11.\nDefine each frozen food distributor 's frozen meat products as I; W = N + F = 8 + 3 = 11; So I = S + W = 6 + 11 = 17.\nDefine each frozen food distributor 's Frozen_Food as V; So V = J + I = 11 + 17 = 5.\nDefine each metal fabrication shop 's frozen food distributor as o; So o = 21 * V = 21 * 5 = 13.\nDefine each canned goods wholesaler 's frozen bread as G; J = V + S = 5 + 6 = 11; C = J + I = 11 + 17 = 5; So G = o + C = 13 + 5 = 18.\nDefine each canned goods wholesaler 's frozen meat products as Z; So Z = 10.\nDefine each canned goods wholesaler 's Frozen_Food as y; So y = G + Z = 18 + 10 = 5.\nDefine each frozen meat products 's grouper as Y; S = S + I = 0 + 17 = 0; So Y = y + S = 5 + 0 = 5.\nDefine each frozen bread 's grouper as q; So q = Y = 5.\nDefine each metal fabrication shop 's canned goods wholesaler as m; So m = 22 * q = 22 * 5 = 18.\nDefine each metal fabrication shop 's Food_Wholesale as O; So O = o + m = 13 + 18 = 8.\nDefine each frozen bread 's mackerel as H; v = O - F = 8 - 3 = 5; So H = 21 + v = 21 + 5 = 3.\n"}
