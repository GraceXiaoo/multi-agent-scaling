"""Question: In a given population, 1 out of every 400 people has a cancer caused by a completely recessive allele, b. Assuming the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, which of the following is the expected proportion of individuals who carry the b allele but are not expected to develop the cancer?
Choices:
(A) 1/400
(B) 19/400
(C) 20/400
(D) 38/400
Let's think step by step: 
The expected proportion of individuals who carry the b allele but are not expected to develop the cancer equals to the frequency of heterozygous allele in the given population. 
According to the Hardy-Weinberg equation p‚àß2 + 2pq + q‚àß2 = 1, where p is the frequency of dominant allele frequency, q is the frequency of recessive allele frequency, p‚àß2 is the frequency of the homozygous dominant allele, q‚àß2 is the frequency of the recessive allele, and 2pq is the frequency of the heterozygous allele. 
Given that q‚àß2=1/400, hence, q=0.05 and p=1-q=0.95. 
The frequency of the heterozygous allele is 2pq=2*0.05*0.95=38/400.
The answer is (D)

"""Question: A Fe pellet of 0.056 g is first dissolved in 10 mL of hydrobromic acid HBr (0.1 M). The resulting solution is then titrated by KMnO4 (0.02 M). How many equivalence points are there?
Choices:
(A) Two points, 25 ml and 35 ml
(B) One point, 25 mL 
(C) One point, 10 ml
(D) Two points, 25 ml and 30 ml
Let's think step by step:
HBr will react with Fe to produce Fe2+. MnO4- will first react with Fe2+ then Br-.
Two equivalence points will exist 25 ml and 35 ml.
HBr will react with Fe to produce Fe2+. MnO4- will first react with Fe2+ then Br-.
Two equivalence points will exist 25 ml and 35 ml.
In the beaker there is Fe2+ and Br-.
When considering titration with two analytes one will have to consider which reaction will occur first. 
Since it is a redox titration consider the reduction potential of:
E0 (Br2 /Br- ) = 1.09 V  	E0 (MnO4-/ Mn2+) = 1.49 V	E0 (Fe3+/Fe2+) =0.77 V	
[Fe2+]=m/MV=0.1M.
Reaction 1: 		MnO4-   +  5Fe2+ + 8H+    ‚Üí 	Mn2+	+    5Fe3+ + 4H2O
Reaction 2: 		2MnO4-   +  10Br-   + 16H+    ‚Üí 	2Mn2+	+    5Br2     + 8H2O
So MnO4- will first react with Fe2+ with a stoichiometry of 1:5 so Veq1 will be 10 ml.
Then when Fe2+ is used up, MnO4- will react with Br- with a stoichiometry of 2:10 then V added will be 25 ml so Veq2=25+10=35 ml.
The answer is (A)
